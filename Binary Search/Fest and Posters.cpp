Approach :- Binary Search in range (1 to 10^15) ,
            why till 10^15 , because we can finish all the given problems in worst case in (10^7)*10^7 time = 10^14 , here in worst case you can consider 
            there is just one student and he take 10^7 time per problem and you have to solve 10^7 problems.
            
Time Complexity :- O( n log n)
